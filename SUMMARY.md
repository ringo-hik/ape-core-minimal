# APE Core Implementation Summary

## Overview

APE Core provides the core functionality for the Agentic Pipeline Engine (APE) system, focusing on:

1. LLM service integration with customizable model configuration via environment variables
2. External service integrations for Jira, S3/Pocket, SWDP (SQL), and Bitbucket
3. Orchestration capabilities for coordinating multiple agents

## Key Components

### LLM Service

- **Location**: `src/core/llm_service.py`
- **Features**:
  - Static configuration through environment variables (`DEFAULT_MODEL`)
  - Support for multiple model providers (Claude, GPT, Qwen)
  - Header customization based on selected model
  - Unified API for sending requests and processing responses

### Agent System

- **Base Interfaces**: `src/core/agent_interface.py`
  - `BaseAgent`: Common interface for all agents
  - `DBAgent`: For database interaction agents
  - `ServiceAgent`: For external API service agents

### Service Integrations

- **Jira Agent**: `src/agents/jira_agent.py`
  - Issue tracking and project management functionality
  - Support for creating, updating, and searching issues

- **Pocket (S3) Agent**: `src/agents/pocket_agent.py`
  - S3-compatible object storage integration
  - Support for bucket and object operations

- **SWDP (SQL) Agent**: `src/agents/swdp_agent.py`
  - Software Development Platform database access
  - Support for SQL queries and schema exploration

- **Bitbucket Agent**: `src/agents/bitbucket_agent.py`
  - Source code management integration
  - Support for repositories, pull requests, and files

### Orchestration

- **Orchestrator**: `src/agents/orchestrator.py`
  - Coordination of multiple agents
  - Workflow definition and execution
  - Context passing between workflow steps
  - Dynamic workflow planning using LLM

## Configuration

The system is configured primarily through environment variables defined in the `.env` file, including:

- LLM service configuration (endpoint, model, API keys)
- Service-specific configurations (URLs, credentials)

## Usage

The core functionalities can be used independently or orchestrated together for complex workflows:

```python
# Example: Using LLM service directly
from ape_core.src.core.llm_service import LLMService

llm = LLMService()
result = llm.send_request([{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}])

# Example: Orchestrating multiple agents
from ape_core.src.agents.orchestrator import Orchestrator
from ape_core.src.agents.jira_agent import JiraAgent

orchestrator = Orchestrator()
orchestrator.register_agent("jira", JiraAgent())

# Define and execute a workflow
orchestrator.register_workflow("process_task", [
    {"agent": "jira", "action": "get_issue", "parameters": {"issue_key": "APE-123"}}
])
result = orchestrator.execute_workflow("process_task")
```

## Testing

A basic test script (`test_llm.py`) is included to verify LLM service functionality. However, due to API key restrictions, actual LLM API calls were not successfully tested during initial implementation.

## Next Steps

1. **Authentication**: Set up proper API keys for testing with OpenRouter or similar services
2. **Additional Agents**: Implement additional agents as needed
3. **Workflow Templates**: Create common workflow templates for typical use cases
